### 2. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file and add the following:

   ```env
   PORT=5001
   MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB Connection String>
   DATABASE_NAME=<Your MongoDB Database Name>
   COLLECTION_NAME=<Your MongoDB Collection Name>
   GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY=<Your Google Geocoding API Key>
   NEWS_API_KEY=<Your NewsAPI Key>
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your OpenAI Key>
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   nodemon app.js
   ```
   The backend will run at `http://localhost:5001`.

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 4. Run Both (Backend and Frontend) Setup

1. Navigate to the root folder

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install concurrently:
   ```bash
   npm install concurrently
   ```

4. Start both of the backend and frontend development server:
   ```bash
   concurrently "npm run start:backend" "npm run start:frontend"
   ```
   The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üåê API Keys Management

- Replace placeholders in the `.env` file with your API keys:
  - `GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY` for Google Maps.
  - `NEWS_API_KEY` for fetching articles from NewsAPI.
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` for extracting disruption type, severity, and location insights.

---

## üêû Debugging and Logging

For debugging, add `console.log` statements in the following places:
- **Backend**: Inside MongoDB queries and API response blocks
- **Frontend**: Check responses using `console.log(response.data)` after API calls.
